# Schools of Zen :cherry_blossom:

Zen Buddhism developed into three main schools in Japan, each with distinctive approaches while sharing fundamental meditation practices. Understanding these traditions enriches your practice without requiring sectarian commitment.

## :mountain: Sōtō Zen (曹洞宗)

### Origins and Founder

-   Established in Japan by **Dōgen Zenji** (1200-1253)
-   Emphasis on **gradual cultivation** and **just sitting**
-   Largest Zen school in Japan today

### Key Characteristics

**Shikantaza ("Just Sitting"):**

-   Pure sitting meditation without objects or goals
-   Practice itself is enlightenment, not means to enlightenment
-   Equal emphasis on form and formless awareness

**Teaching Style:**

-   Patient, gradual instruction
-   Emphasis on everyday activities as practice
-   Detailed attention to ritual and form

**Philosophy:**

-   Buddha nature is already present, practice reveals it
-   No separation between practice and enlightenment
-   Emphasizes **ordinary mind** and daily life integration

!!! quote "Dōgen's Teaching"
"To study the Buddha Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to be actualized by myriad things."

## :fire: Rinzai Zen (臨済宗)

### Origins and Approach

-   Established by **Eisai** (1141-1215), refined by many masters
-   Emphasis on **sudden enlightenment** and dynamic methods
-   Known for intensive training methods

### Key Characteristics

**Koan Practice:**

-   Paradoxical stories and questions (_koans_)
-   Designed to exhaust conceptual thinking
-   Teacher-student dialogue (_dokusan_) central to training

**Teaching Style:**

-   Direct, sometimes confrontational methods
-   Emphasis on breakthrough experiences
-   Intensive retreat practice (_sesshin_)

**Philosophy:**

-   Sudden realization possible in any moment
-   Dynamic interaction between teacher and student
-   Breaking through conceptual limitations

**Famous Koans:**

-   "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"
-   "Does a dog have Buddha nature? Mu!"
-   "What is your original face before birth?"

!!! note "Koan Caution"
Traditional koan study requires qualified teacher guidance. Intellectual approach misses the point entirely.

## :lotus_position: Ōbaku Zen (黄檗宗)

### Origins and Characteristics

-   Smallest of three schools, founded by **Ingen** (1592-1673)
