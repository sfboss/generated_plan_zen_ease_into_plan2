# Welcome to Your Zen Practice Journey :cherry_blossom:

Welcome, and thank you for choosing to explore the profound simplicity of Zen practice. Whether you're completely new to meditation or returning to practice after time away, this moment marks the beginning of a transformative journey that has been walked by countless practitioners for over 1,500 years.

## :seedling: What is Zen Practice?

Zen (_禅_, from Sanskrit _dhyāna_ meaning "meditation") is a school of Buddhism that emphasizes direct experience and present-moment awareness. At its heart, Zen practice is beautifully simple:

-   **Sitting meditation** (_zazen_ - "just sitting")
-   **Walking meditation** (_kinhin_ - mindful movement)
-   **Mindful daily activities** - bringing awareness to ordinary tasks
-   **Ethical living** - compassion and wisdom in action

!!! quote "The Way of Zen"
"Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise. Seek what they sought." - _Matsuo Bashō_

## :compass: Your Journey Ahead

This 90-day plan is structured as a gentle, progressive journey:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-7) :herb:

You'll learn proper posture, basic breathing, and establish a daily rhythm. We start with just 5-10 minutes to build confidence and consistency.

### Phase 2: Stabilization (Days 8-21) :deciduous_tree:

Practice time increases to 12-15 minutes as you develop concentration and introduce walking meditation.

### Phase 3: Deepening (Days 22-45) :evergreen_tree:

Extended sitting (18-22 minutes) with introduction to traditional elements like chanting and bowing.

### Phase 4: Integration (Days 46-60) :mountain:

Flexible scheduling and mindful daily activities help you integrate practice into real life.

### Phase 5: Expansion (Days 61-90) :ocean:

Advanced techniques, personal adaptation, and building resilience for lifelong practice.

## :heart: What to Expect

### The Benefits (Potential, Not Promised)

Regular Zen practice may help you experience:

-   **Increased calm** and emotional stability
-   **Improved focus** and mental clarity
-   **Greater self-awareness** and insight
-   **Enhanced compassion** for yourself and others
-   **Reduced reactivity** to stress and difficulty
-   **Deeper appreciation** for simple moments

!!! caution "Important Reminder"
These are potential benefits observed by many practitioners. Zen practice is not therapy, medical treatment, or a cure for psychological or physical conditions. Individual experiences vary greatly.

### The Challenges (Also Normal)

You'll likely encounter:

-   **Restlessness** and physical discomfort
-   **Mental chatter** and wandering thoughts
-   **Resistance** to sitting still
-   **Doubt** about whether you're "doing it right"
-   **Inconsistency** in daily practice

!!! tip "The Secret"
These challenges _are_ the practice. Working with restlessness, thoughts, and resistance with gentle persistence is exactly what develops wisdom and patience.
