# Day 15: Extended Practice Integration :deciduous_tree:

<div class="phase-banner">
<h2>Phase 2: Stabilization</h2>
<p>Midway through Phase 2, we focus on seamless integration of sitting and walking practice with sustained awareness.</p>
</div>

## Intent :dart:

Two weeks of practice have built your foundation. Today's intention is to experience sitting and walking as one continuous meditation, developing the skill of maintaining awareness through transitions.

## Core Practice :lotus_position:

**Duration:** 15 minutes total (10m sitting + 5m walking)  
**Focus:** Seamless awareness through different postures

### Instructions:

1. **Sitting phase (10 minutes):**

    - Establish posture with confidence
    - Begin with three settling breaths
    - Focus on breath for 5 minutes
    - Expand to open awareness for 5 minutes

2. **Transition mindfully** - rise slowly maintaining meditation mind

3. **Walking phase (5 minutes):**
    - Extremely slow kinhin pace
    - Coordinate breathing with steps
    - Same quality of awareness as sitting
    - End standing for 30 seconds

## Technique Focus :microscope:

**Mastering Transitions:**

-   The moment of standing up is meditation
-   Maintain breath awareness while moving
-   Walking isn't break from meditation - it IS meditation
-   Same alertness, different posture

## Cultural Insight :cherry_blossom:

<div class="cultural-insight">
In traditional monasteries, the walking period between sitting sessions maintains the meditative state while allowing blood circulation. Monks move so slowly that the walking itself becomes a form of moving stillness.
</div>

## Mindful Action :footprints:

Apply transition awareness to three daily activities - notice the moment of changing from one activity to another and maintain brief awareness through the shift.

## Metrics to Track :bar_chart:

-   **Sitting concentration (1-5):** \_\_\_
-   **Walking coordination (1-5):** \_\_\_
-   **Transition smoothness (1-5):** \_\_\_

## Tomorrow Preview :arrow_forward:

Day 16 introduces working with emotional content that arises during practice.
