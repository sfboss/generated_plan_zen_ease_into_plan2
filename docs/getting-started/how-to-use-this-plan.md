# How to Use This Plan :map:

This comprehensive guide helps you navigate your 90-day Zen practice journey effectively, whether you follow it exactly as designed or adapt it to your unique circumstances.

## :compass: Plan Structure Overview

### Hierarchical Organization

**Phases** (5 phases, ~18 days each)
: Major developmental periods with distinct learning objectives

**Daily Practices** (90 individual days)
: Complete practice sessions with specific instructions and progressions

**Supporting Content**
: Background knowledge, troubleshooting, and enrichment materials

### Navigation Pathways

**Linear path:** Follow days 1-90 sequentially (recommended for most practitioners)

**Phase-based:** Study phase overviews, then complete daily practices within each phase

**Topic-based:** Use tag system and cross-references to explore specific interests

**Flexible:** Adapt duration, intensity, and elements based on your needs

## :gear: Customization Options

### Duration Flexibility

**Standard approach:** 90 consecutive days

-   Daily practice as prescribed
-   Sequential progression through phases
-   Full completion in approximately 3 months

**Extended approach:** 120-180 days

-   Repeat challenging days or phases
-   Take rest days between phases
-   Deeper exploration of enrichment content

**Compressed approach:** 60-75 days

-   Combine similar days within phases
-   Focus on core practices, skip optional expansions
-   Maintain essential progression elements

!!! tip "Consistency Over Perfection"
Research shows that practicing 5 minutes daily for 90 days is more beneficial than practicing 30 minutes sporadically. Adapt duration to maintain consistency.

### Practice Time Adaptations

**Morning practitioners:**

-   Use full instructions as written
-   Consider shorter evening reflection sessions
-   Integrate mindful action throughout workday

**Evening practitioners:**

-   Reduce intensity for relaxation before sleep
-   Emphasize reflection and gratitude elements
-   Add brief morning intention-setting

**Multiple sessions:**

-   Split longer practices into morning/evening segments
-   Use walking meditation as midday reset
-   Maintain total daily practice time

**Time-constrained:**

-   Minimum effective dose: 3-5 minutes daily
-   Focus on sitting meditation, add walking when possible
-   Prioritize consistency over comprehensive content
