# Posture & Breath Fundamentals :mountain:

Proper posture and breath awareness form the foundation of effective Zen practice. These elements support both physical comfort and mental clarity throughout your meditation journey.

## :straight_ruler: Establishing Good Posture

### The Seven-Point Posture

1. **Base of Support**: Stable triangle (two knees + sitting bones) or stable foundation (feet on floor for chair)
2. **Spine**: Naturally erect, following natural curves without forcing
3. **Shoulders**: Relaxed and even, not pulled back or hunched forward
4. **Arms**: Hanging naturally with hands resting comfortably
5. **Head**: Balanced on spine, chin slightly tucked, crown reaching toward sky
6. **Eyes**: Softly closed or gazing downward at 45-degree angle
7. **Mouth**: Lips lightly closed, tongue resting naturally

### Sitting Options

**Floor Sitting:**

-   Half or full lotus (if flexible)
-   Burmese position (both feet on floor)
-   Seiza (kneeling with cushion support)

**Chair Sitting:**

-   Feet flat on floor
-   Back away from chair back if possible
-   Hands on thighs or in lap

!!! tip "Comfort First"
Choose the position you can maintain with least adjustment. Discomfort distracts from meditation.

### Key Principles

-   **Don't control the breath** - observe its natural rhythm
-   **Choose one location** - nostrils, chest, or belly
-   **Notice qualities** - temperature, depth, smoothness
-   **Use as anchor** - return attention here when mind wanders

### Common Breathing Practices

**Simple Observation:**
Just notice breath without changing anything

**Breath Counting:**
Count exhalations 1-10, then repeat

**Breath Coordination:**
Eventually coordinate with walking meditation

## :question: Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Physical discomfort**: Adjust position immediately, use props, try chair
**Breathing feels forced**: Step back to just noticing, don't control
**Can't find comfortable position**: Experiment with different options over several days
**Sleepiness**: Check if you're practicing when tired, adjust posture
