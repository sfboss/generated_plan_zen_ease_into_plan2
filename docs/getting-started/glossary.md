## :question: Common Questions

**Am I doing it right?**
: If you're sitting with sincere intention and awareness, you're doing it right. There's no perfect meditation.

**Should I stop my thoughts?**
: No. Observe thoughts without judgment. Trying to stop thoughts creates more thinking.

**What if I feel nothing special?**
: Perfect. Zen is about ordinary mind. Seeking special experiences creates attachment and suffering.

**How long until I see benefits?**
: Benefits often appear gradually. Some notice changes in weeks, others in months. Trust the process.
