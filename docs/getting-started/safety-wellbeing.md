# Safety & Wellbeing Guidelines :shield:

Your physical and mental wellbeing are the foundation of beneficial practice. Please read this section carefully before beginning any meditation practice.

## :warning: Important Disclaimers

### Not Medical or Therapeutic Advice

This meditation plan is **educational content only** and is not:

-   Medical advice or treatment
-   Psychotherapy or counseling
-   Treatment for any physical or mental health condition
-   A substitute for professional healthcare

!!! caution "Consult Healthcare Providers"
**Always consult qualified healthcare professionals** for:

    - Physical health concerns or limitations
    - Mental health conditions or symptoms
    - Questions about medication interactions
    - Any changes in your health during practice

### Not Religious Instruction

While drawing from Buddhist wisdom traditions, this plan provides secular meditation instruction. It is not religious teaching, conversion material, or spiritual counseling.

## :heart: Physical Safety

### Posture Considerations

**Back/Neck Issues:**

-   Use chairs instead of floor sitting if needed
-   Never force painful positions
-   Modify postures for your body's needs
-   Take breaks whenever necessary

**Joint Problems:**

-   Avoid cross-legged positions if painful
-   Use additional cushions for support
-   Chair practice is equally effective
-   Listen to your body's limits

**Pregnancy:**

-   Consult your healthcare provider first
-   Avoid prolonged floor sitting if uncomfortable
-   Modify positions as needed
-   Stop if you experience any concerning symptoms

!!! tip "Golden Rule"
**Pain is not part of the practice.** Mild discomfort as you adjust to new postures is normal, but sharp pain, numbness, or persistent discomfort means you should modify your position immediately.

### When to Stop Practice

Stop meditation and seek appropriate help if you experience:

-   Severe or worsening physical pain
-   Dizziness, nausea, or faintness
-   Difficulty breathing
-   Panic attacks or severe anxiety
-   Any concerning physical symptoms

## :brain: Mental Health Considerations

### Trauma and Difficult Emotions

Meditation can sometimes bring up difficult emotions or memories. This is normal but requires careful attention:

**Normal experiences:**

-   Occasional sadness, anxiety, or irritation
-   Memories arising during quiet sitting
-   Emotional releases or tears
-   Temporary increase in awareness of stress

**Concerning experiences:**

-   Overwhelming emotional distress
-   Panic attacks or severe anxiety
-   Intrusive traumatic memories
-   Dissociation or feeling "unreal"
-   Persistent disturbing thoughts

!!! warning "Trauma-Informed Approach"
If you have a history of trauma, PTSD, or severe mental health conditions:

    - Consult a qualified mental health professional before beginning
    - Consider trauma-informed meditation approaches
    - Start with very short sessions (2-3 minutes)
    - Keep eyes slightly open if closed-eye practice feels unsafe
    - Have support resources readily available

### Pre-existing Mental Health Conditions

**Depression:**

-   Meditation can be helpful but is not treatment
-   Monitor for worsening symptoms
-   Maintain professional treatment relationships
-   Consider group or guided practice for support

**Anxiety Disorders:**

-   Start with shorter sessions
-   Focus on grounding techniques
-   Don't force relaxation - observe whatever arises
-   Breathing exercises may initially increase anxiety for some people

**Psychosis or Bipolar Disorder:**

-   Consult your psychiatrist before beginning
-   Intensive meditation may not be appropriate during acute episodes
-   Maintain medication compliance
-   Have a support plan in place

## ⚖️ Healthy Practice Guidelines

### Start Gradually

-   Begin with 5-10 minute sessions
-   Increase duration slowly over weeks
-   Consistency matters more than duration
-   Don't rush into advanced practices

### Maintain Balance

-   Practice enhances life, not replaces it
-   Keep social connections and activities
-   Don't isolate yourself in practice
-   Balance meditation with movement and engagement

### Seek Guidance When Needed

-   Consider finding a qualified teacher for deeper instruction
-   Join meditation groups for community support
-   Read additional resources from reputable sources
-   Don't hesitate to ask questions
