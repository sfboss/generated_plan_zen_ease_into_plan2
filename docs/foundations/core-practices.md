# Core Zen Practices :lotus_position:

Understanding the fundamental practices of Zen provides the foundation for your 90-day journey and lifelong cultivation. These core techniques have been refined over centuries to support awakening and beneficial living.

## :mountain: Zazen - Sitting Meditation

_Zazen_ (座禅) literally means "just sitting" - the heart of Zen practice.

### Physical Foundation

**Posture Options:**

=== "Floor Sitting"
**Full Lotus:** Both feet on opposite thighs (advanced flexibility required)

    **Half Lotus:** One foot on opposite thigh, other foot tucked under

    **Burmese:** Both feet flat on floor in front of you

    **Seiza:** Kneeling, sitting on heels (use cushion for comfort)

=== "Chair Sitting"
**Standard Chair:** Feet flat on floor, back straight but not rigid

    **Meditation Bench:** Kneeling position with bench support

    **Cushioned Chair:** Additional support for comfort during longer sits

!!! tip "Posture Principles" - **Stability:** Base of support should feel solid and balanced - **Uprightness:** Spine naturally erect, like a stack of coins - **Relaxation:** Alert but not tense, soft but not slumped - **Sustainability:** Choose positions you can maintain with minimal adjustment

### Hand Positions (Mudras)

**Cosmic Mudra (Traditional Zen):**

-   Left hand on top of right hand
-   Thumbs touching lightly to form an oval
-   Hands rest in lap against lower belly
-   Oval opening faces upward

**Alternative Mudras:**

-   **Simple rest:** Hands on knees or in lap naturally
-   **Gyan mudra:** Thumb touching index finger tips
-   **Open palms:** Facing upward on knees

### Eyes and Gaze

**Traditional approach:** Eyes slightly open, gazing downward at 45-degree angle about 3 feet ahead. This prevents drowsiness while avoiding visual distractions.

**Adaptations:** Closed eyes acceptable if open eyes feel distracting. Experiment to find what supports stable awareness.

### Breathing

!!! note "Natural Breathing"
In zazen, we don't control the breath - we observe it. Allow natural rhythm while maintaining awareness.

**Basic technique:**

1. Observe breath at nostrils, chest, or belly - choose one location
2. Notice inhalation and exhalation naturally
3. When mind wanders, gently return to breath awareness
4. No need to count or control - just observe

**Breath counting (optional):**

-   Count exhalations from 1 to 10, then start over
-   If you lose count, simply begin again at 1
-   This gives the mind a light task while developing concentration

## :footprints: Kinhin - Walking Meditation

_Kinhin_ (経行) bridges sitting meditation and daily life through mindful walking.

### Basic Technique

**Pace:** Extremely slow - approximately one step every 3-6 seconds
**Duration:** Usually 5-10 minutes between sitting periods
**Path:** Straight line 6-10 steps, turn around, repeat

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Standing transition:** Rise slowly from sitting, maintaining awareness
2. **Hand position:** Traditional form has left fist at chest level, right hand covering
3. **First step:** Lift foot slowly, move forward, place mindfully
4. **Breathing:** One breath per step, or one breath per two steps
5. **Awareness:** Focus on sensations of lifting, moving, placing feet
6. **Turning:** Pause at path end, turn slowly 180 degrees, continue
7. **Integration:** Same quality of awareness as sitting meditation

!!! example "Kinhin Benefits" - Prevents stiffness during long meditation sessions - Develops awareness that functions through movement - Bridges formal practice and daily walking - Provides alternative when sitting feels difficult

### Outdoor Kinhin

Walking meditation can extend beyond formal practice:

-   **Nature walking:** Slow, mindful movement in natural settings
-   **Daily walking:** Bringing kinhin awareness to ordinary walking
-   **Urban practice:** Mindful navigation of city environments

## :pray: Bowing and Gratitude Practices

### Gassho (合掌)

Placing palms together in front of heart - expresses gratitude, respect, and unity.

**When to use:**

-   Beginning and ending practice sessions
-   Expressing gratitude or respect
-   Transitional moments in practice

### Bowing (Rei - 礼)

Physical expression of humility and interconnection.

**Standing bow:**

-   Hands in gassho, bow from waist approximately 30 degrees
-   Brief pause in bowed position
-   Return to upright with same awareness

**Prostration (optional):**

-   Full bow touching forehead to ground
-   Expresses deep gratitude and letting go of ego
-   Traditional in temple settings, optional in home practice

## :sound: Chanting Practice

### Purpose of Chanting

-   Unifies body, breath, and mind
-   Connects with traditional lineage
-   Develops concentration and devotion
-   Expresses gratitude and intention

### Simple Chants for Beginners

**Heart Sutra Mantra:**
_Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā_
("Gone, gone, gone beyond, gone completely beyond, awakening, so be it!")

**Three Refuges:**

-   _Buddham saranam gacchāmi_ (I take refuge in the Buddha)
-   _Dhammam saranam gacchāmi_ (I take refuge in the Dharma)
-   _Sangham saranam gacchāmi_ (I take refuge in the Sangha)

!!! caution "Secular Approach"
Chanting can be practiced as meditation technique without religious commitment. The repetitive sounds and meanings support concentration regardless of belief.

## :house: Samu - Work Practice

_Samu_ (作務) means "work practice" - bringing meditative awareness to daily activities.

### Principles of Samu

**Single-pointed attention:** Complete focus on the task at hand
**No wasted motion:** Efficient, mindful movement
**Appreciation:** Gratitude for the opportunity to contribute
**No separation:** Work and meditation are one activity

### Daily Life Applications

**Kitchen practice:**

-   Mindful preparation, cooking, eating, cleaning
-   Attention to textures, temperatures, sounds
-   Gratitude for food and those who provided it

**Cleaning practice:**

-   Full attention to sweeping, wiping, organizing
-   Appreciation for orderly, clean environment
-   No task too humble for complete engagement

**Communication practice:**

-   Mindful listening without planning responses
-   Speaking with intention and kindness
-   Silence as valuable as words

## :seedling: Koan Practice (Introduction)

_Koan_ (公案) are traditional stories or questions designed to provoke insight beyond intellectual understanding.

!!! warning "Beginner Caution"
Traditional koan study requires qualified teacher guidance. What follows is gentle introduction only.

### Famous Koans

**Jōshū's Dog:**
"Does a dog have Buddha nature?" Jōshū answered, "Mu" (No/Nothing).

**One Hand Clapping:**
"What is the sound of one hand clapping?"

**Original Face:**
"What is your original face before your mother and father were born?"

### Gentle Approach for Beginners

-   Read koan slowly several times
-   Sit with the question without trying to solve it intellectually
-   Notice what arises - confusion, images, insights
-   Don't grasp for "correct" answers
-   Let the koan work on you rather than working on the koan
