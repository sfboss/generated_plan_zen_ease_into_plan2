# Day 3: Body Awareness Integration :herb:

## Intent :dart:

Today we expand beyond breath alone to include body awareness, creating a fuller foundation for meditation practice while maintaining the gentle approach of early learning.

## Core Practice üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Duration:** 6 minutes  
**Focus:** Whole-body awareness with breath as anchor

### Instructions:

1. **Establish familiar posture** - notice what feels automatic now
2. **Begin with breath** - 1 minute of breath observation
3. **Expand to body** - notice physical sensations while keeping breath awareness
4. **Scan systematically** - head to toe, observing without changing
5. **Return to breath** - final minute anchored in breathing
6. **Close with appreciation** - brief gratitude for body's support

## Technique Focus :microscope:

**Body Scanning Basics:**

-   Notice tension, relaxation, temperature, pressure
-   No need to change anything - just observe
-   Include both comfort and discomfort equally
-   Use breath as steady anchor when overwhelmed

## Cultural Insight :cherry_blossom:

<div class="cultural-insight">
Traditional Zen emphasizes the unity of body and mind - not separate entities but one seamless experience. Body awareness isn't preparation for "real" meditation; it's meditation itself.
</div>

## Mindful Action :footprints:

Practice body awareness during one daily activity - notice physical sensations while washing hands, walking, or stretching.

## Tomorrow Preview :arrow_forward:

Day 4 introduces working more skillfully with thoughts and emotions that arise during practice.
