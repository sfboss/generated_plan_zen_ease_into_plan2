## ⚖️ Making Adjustments

### When to Modify Practice

-   Consistently struggling to complete sessions
-   Physical discomfort preventing concentration
-   Emotional intensity feels overwhelming
-   Life circumstances require more flexibility

**Increase duration if:**

-   Current length feels too short
-   Comfortable with existing practice for 2+ weeks
-   Naturally sitting longer without effort
-   Inspired to deepen practice

**Modify approach if:**

-   Current method isn't working after honest trial
-   Different technique might better suit your temperament
-   Traditional teacher recommends specific adjustments
-   Medical or psychological considerations arise

## :heart: Self-Compassion Guidelines

### Realistic Expectations

-   **Progress isn't linear** - expect ups and downs
-   **Missed days are normal** - gentle return more important than perfect attendance
-   **Comparing with others is unhelpful** - your practice is unique
-   **Benefits often appear gradually** - trust the process

### Gentle Accountability

-   **Honest assessment without harsh judgment**
-   **Adjustment as wisdom, not failure**
-   **Celebrating small consistencies**
-   **Learning from challenges rather than avoiding them**
