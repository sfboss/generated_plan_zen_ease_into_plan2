# Week 1 Practice Review - First Steps on the Path

_"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."_ - Lao Tzu

## This Week's Highlights

### Wins & Breakthroughs ‚ú®

This first week has been a gentle introduction to the world of Zen practice. The biggest breakthrough was simply showing up each day, even when my mind felt scattered or I was tired.

**Key wins:**

-   **Consistency**: Practiced 6 out of 7 days (missed Sunday due to family commitments)
-   **Finding my spot**: Created a dedicated practice corner with a simple cushion
-   **Breath awareness**: Starting to notice the natural rhythm of breathing without forcing
-   **Morning routine**: Successfully integrated 5-10 minutes before morning coffee

### Challenges & Obstacles üåä

The main challenge has been the restless mind - what our instructions call "monkey mind." During sitting, thoughts would jump from today's to-do list to random memories to planning dinner.

**Specific struggles:**

-   **Physical discomfort**: Legs falling asleep during longer sits
-   **Time perception**: 10 minutes feeling like an hour some days
-   **Self-judgment**: Catching myself being critical about "doing it wrong"
-   **Environmental distractions**: Morning birds are beautiful but sometimes pulling attention

### Adjustments for Next Week üîÑ

Based on this week's experience, I'm making these gentle adjustments:

1. **Physical comfort**: Adding a small cushion under my knees for better posture
2. **Time flexibility**: Some days 5 minutes, some days 15 - honoring what feels sustainable
3. **Environment**: Practicing with soft background sounds (nature audio) to mask distractions
4. **Self-compassion**: When mind wanders, simply noting "thinking" and returning to breath without judgment

### Practice Consistency üìä

-   **Days practiced**: 6/7 days
-   **Average session length**: 8 minutes
-   **Missed days**: Sunday (family brunch ran long - and that's okay!)
-   **Best practice day**: Wednesday morning - felt calm and centered afterward
-   **Most challenging**: Friday evening - exhausted from work, mind very busy

### Emerging Questions ü§î

-   Is it normal for the mind to be this active? (Yes, according to the materials!)
-   How do I know if I'm "doing it right"?
-   When does the busy mind start to settle?
-   Should I be trying to stop thoughts or just watch them?

_Note to self: These questions are part of the path. Trust the process._

### Lifestyle Integration Score: 7/10 üå±

The practice is starting to weave into daily life naturally. I notice brief moments of mindfulness throughout the day - pausing before reacting, taking conscious breaths during stress, appreciating small moments of beauty.

### Gentle Self-Compassion Statement üíö

_"You showed up with beginner's mind this week. Every moment of awareness, every return to breath, every time you sat down to practice was perfect exactly as it was. Your willingness to begin this journey takes courage. Be gentle with yourself as you learn."_

## Looking Ahead to Week 2

Next week begins Phase 2 (Stabilization). I'm curious about building on this foundation while maintaining the gentle, non-forcing approach that felt right this week.

The goal isn't perfection - it's showing up with presence and kindness toward whatever arises.
